# Plugin SDK

This crate contains structs and functions used by the runtime and editor to interface with your plugins.

Use the plugin template to get started creating your vectarine plugin.

You can use this crate to reference functions and structs.

This crate is also used to contain library common to the editor and the runtime like Lua or SDL2 to ensure that the same version is used in both.
