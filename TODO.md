# TODO

- [ ] More complete drawing API
  - [ ] Draw portions of images (the super general case with 8 vec2 as arguments, so 16 floats)
  - [ ] Rotation of images
  - [ ] Lines
  - [ ] Quads
  - [ ] Polygons
  - [ ] Outlines
- [ ] Resource update
  - [ ] Move loading state management out of the individual resources
  - [ ] Scripts are resources
  - [ ] Check resource status from Lua (Loaded, Error, Loading, ...)
- [ ] Canvas API
- [ ] 'Screen' system (Menu, Settings, Game, Pause...)
- [ ] Project System in the editor
  - [ ] 'assets' should be 'gamedata'
  - [ ] Have a game.toml inside 'gamedata'. It is loaded first instead of game.lua
    - [ ] Manifest contains name of the game, logo and root source.
    - [ ] Until the first script is loaded (an update function is available in the lua env), a splash screen is displayed.
  - [ ] Open manifest in the editor from the file menu
  - [ ] Allow opening zips that are "compiled projects" (from the runtime)
  - [ ] Have an export feature in the editor to make zips
- [ ] Investigate how to have true interactive web documentation
  - [ ] Add a 'docs' emscripten target.
  - [ ] JavaScript API to interact with the runtime (in this 'docs' project)
  - [ ] Ability to switch projects and load resources from the JS
- [ ] Tiled parsing
  - [ ] Sprites as an asset class
  - [ ] Reading tiled files
- [ ] Aseprite support
- [ ] Potential performance improvements
  - [ ] No base64 for loading data on the web
  - [ ] Use rect_pack for texture atlases, text rendering instead of the naive way.
  - [ ] Use vec2 for drawing 2d shapes instead of vec3 (inside default shaders)
  - [ ] Check if StreamDraw / StaticDraw actually does something
