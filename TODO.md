# TO-DO

- [ ] Project System in the editor
  - [x] 'assets' should be 'gamedata'
  - [x] Refactor to make the project path a variable
  - [x] Have a game.toml inside 'gamedata'. It is loaded first instead of game.lua
    - [x] Manifest contains name of the game, logo, tags, and root source.
    - [ ] Load the manifest and store its data
    - [ ] Until the first script is loaded (an update function is available in the lua env), a splash screen is displayed.
  - [x] Remember the last opened project and open it at startup
  - [x] Allow closing the current project
  - [x] Allow reopening aka 'reset' of games
  - [ ] Fix live-reload as we need to only live-reload the current opened project
  - [ ] Open manifest in the editor from the file menu
  - [ ] Allow opening zips that are "compiled projects" (from the runtime)
  - [ ] Have an export feature in the editor to make zips
- [ ] Add a gallery
  - [ ] Create a gallery folder with a sample game
  - [ ] Show the gallery by default in the editor
  - [ ] Allow creating a game using a piece of the gallery as an example
  - [ ] Show off parts of the API in various gallery games
- [ ] Allow fake fullscreen as an option
- [ ] Save system
  - [ ] Design a simple saving API (probably a KV store with a simple Lua serializer)
  - [ ] Implement the API in Rust
- [ ] Tiled parsing
  - [ ] Sprites as an asset class
  - [ ] Reading tiled files
- [ ] Aseprite support
- [ ] Potential performance improvements
  - [ ] No base64 for loading data on the web
  - [ ] Use rect_pack for texture atlases, text rendering instead of the naive way.
  - [ ] Use vec2 for drawing 2d shapes instead of vec3 (inside default shaders)
  - [ ] Check if StreamDraw / StaticDraw actually does something
- [ ] More complete Lua API
  - [ ] V3, V4
  - [ ] V4 is a color
  - [ ] Default values (if a color is nil, it is infered to be black)
  - [ ] noise function (open simplex, for v2, v3 and v4) and worley
- [ ] Audio API
  - [ ] Create an Audio resource
  - [ ] Play a sound
- [ ] Make a game with it!!!

- [ ] Expose Stencil API to Lua
  - [ ] Define in Luau types: drawWithMask(drawFunction, maskFunction)
  - [ ] Implement in Rust
- [ ] Open-source the project
- [ ] Add a CI
- [ ] Timer event?
- [ ] Bug fixes
  - [ ] Investigate special characters in text rendering (like å, ç, ...)
  - [ ] Antialiasing needs to work with hot reloading
- [ ] Event system, part II
  - [ ] Add event channels (you can have an on-hit event with per-entity filtering. Channels are strings with a hashmap lookup, They are cheap)
- [ ] Make errors/warnings inside Update spam less the console
  - [ ] When the same error happens in a row inside update, only print it once (same behavior as browsers)
- [ ] Better errors:
  - [ ] Show the line that produced the error instead of just the line number. Make the text clickable to open the file
  - [ ] Print errors to the terminal too as the terminal is also convenient
- [ ] Modding API
  - [ ] Add a way to load scripts in a separate environment with a subset of available functions
  - [ ] Add a way to pass data to and from the sandbox
- [ ] The 3D API!!
  - [ ] See how Three.js does things.
  - [ ] Camera
  - [ ] Scene
  - [ ] Geometries + Materials = Mesh
  - [ ] Allow 2d meshs with 'paper style'
  - [ ] Lights and shadows (set a max number of lights to 20 in the API)
  - [ ] Reflective objects like water
  - [ ] Drawing a depth buffer
