# TO-DO

- [ ] Potential performance improvements
  - [ ] Use rect_pack for texture atlases, text rendering instead of the naive way.
  - [ ] Use vec2 for drawing 2d shapes instead of vec3 (inside default shaders)
  - [ ] Check if StreamDraw / StaticDraw actually does something
- [ ] More complete Lua API
  - [ ] noise function (open simplex, for v2, v3 and v4) and worley
  - [ ] The font size of drawText should work with the Coords API
  - [ ] The radius of drawCircle should work with the Coords API


- [ ] Open-source the project
- [ ] True MacOS exports with an app folder
- [ ] Add a CI
  - [ ] See https://github.com/LukeMathWalker/cargo-chef
- [ ] Animation system from multiple PNG files
- [ ] Add search in the resource window
- [ ] Rework the resource API to use futures to prevent use of unloaded resources
- [ ] Aseprite support
  - [ ] Load Aseprite files as images
  - [ ] Load Aseprite files as tilesets
- [ ] Entity system
  - [ ] Add a concept of a 'PhysicsWorld2D'
  - [ ] Under the hood, this is a QuadTree
  - [ ] You can add 'objects' to the physics world (circles, rectangles, etc...)
  - [ ] The objects can have 'tags' (player, enemy, projectile, etc...)
  - [ ] You can easily move and resize objects in the physics world
  - [ ] You can efficiently get objects by tag
  - [ ] You can efficiently get the nearest object to a position / list objects by distance
  - [ ] You can efficiently get all objects that collide with one object
  - [ ] You can efficiently see what objects collide with a ray.
- [ ] Bug fixes
  - [ ] Investigate special characters in text rendering (like å, ç, ...)
  - [ ] Antialiasing needs to work with hot reloading
- [ ] Lua performance helper:
  - [ ] Add a simple matrix API which ways to convert translation, scaling and rotation into matrices
  - [ ] Add a lua function which computes AV + B for a list of V efficiently
  - [ ] Add drawing functions that operate on lists of Lua objects and can perform common linear transformations before drawing
- [ ] Splash screen depending on the loading_animation field in the manifest
- [ ] Play/pause the project in the editor
- [ ] Add a CLI version of the editor
  - [ ] The editor is compiled with -mwindow
  - [ ] The CLI can scafold project, automate exports and run the editor with a console if needed
- [ ] Use SDL pref_path for editor settings and cache.
- [ ] Put the console system outside of Lua Env
  - [ ] Create a logger trait in console.rs
  - [ ] LuaEnv needs a logger to be built and prints writes to the logger.
    - [ ] 3 levels: Info, Warning, Error
  - [ ] The runtime and editor have separate logger implementation
  - [ ] The logger is easily accessible from anywhere in the code even without Lua.
  - [ ] Enable errors and warnings, even for release builds
  - [ ] Add error logs in the code when relevant (to avoid black screens with no other failure message.)
- [ ] Event system, part II
  - [ ] Add event channels (you can have an on-hit event with per-entity filtering. Channels are strings with a hashmap lookup, They are cheap)
  - [ ] Timer event?
- [ ] Make errors/warnings inside Update spam less the console
  - [ ] When the same error happens in a row inside update, only print it once (same behavior as browsers)
- [ ] Better errors:
  - [ ] Show the line that produced the error instead of just the line number. Make the text clickable to open the file
  - [ ] Print errors to the terminal too as the terminal is also convenient
- [ ] Modding API
  - [ ] Add a way to load scripts in a separate environment with a subset of available functions
  - [ ] Add a way to pass data to and from the sandbox
- [ ] Monads for futures
- [ ] The 3D API!!
  - [ ] See how Three.js does things.
  - [ ] Camera
  - [ ] Scene
  - [ ] Geometries + Materials = Mesh
  - [ ] Allow 2d meshs with 'paper style'
  - [ ] Lights and shadows (set a max number of lights to 20 in the API)
  - [ ] Reflective objects like water
  - [ ] Drawing a depth buffer
