## 🌱 Getting started making games

Download [the latest build](https://github.com/vanyle/vectarine/releases/latest) of the engine from the [releases](https://github.com/vanyle/vectarine/releases) page.

Additionally, you'll need:

- A text editor. I recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but you can use Notepad or anything really.
- (Optional) Installing a Luau extension for your editor

See **[The manual](./docs/user-manual.md)** for detailed information on how to make games with vectarine

Feel free to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/zPwg3VDydz) if you have any questions or want to chat with other developers.

Below are information on how to work and improve the engine.
